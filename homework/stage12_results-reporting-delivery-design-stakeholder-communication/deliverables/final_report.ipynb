    "# Final Report — Evaluation & Risk Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "- Scenario analysis highlights clear differences in both return and risk outcomes.  \n",
    "- Baseline scenario performs reasonably well, but alternative cases reveal downside risks.  \n",
    "- Tracking MetricA by category over time provides early warning of structural shifts.  \n",

    "### Risk–Return by Scenario\n",
    "![Risk–Return by Scenario](images/risk_return.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:  \n",
    "This scatter plot compares risk and return across different scenarios. Higher returns are generally associated with higher risk, illustrating the trade-off stakeholders must consider.  \n",
    "**Assumptions**: Scenarios are modeled under stable variance assumptions. Unexpected shocks are not captured.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return by Scenario\n",
    "![Return by Scenario](images/return_by_scenario.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:  \n",
    "The bar chart shows comparative returns across scenarios. Scenario B delivers the strongest return, while Scenario C underperforms relative to the baseline.  \n",
    "**Assumptions**: Returns are based on simulated distributions; model uncertainty remains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### MetricA Over Time by Category\n",
    "![MetricA Over Time by Category](images/metricA_over_time.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:  \n",
    "This line chart tracks MetricA across time, split by category. Divergence after the midpoint suggests potential instability in certain categories.  \n",
    "**Assumptions**: Assumes consistent data reporting frequency and no measurement error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions & Risks\n",
    "- Historical distributions are assumed to continue into the future.  \n",
    "- Tail events are not fully captured by variance-based risk metrics.  \n",
    "- Category stability depends on external factors not modeled here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "| Scenario | Baseline | Adjusted (+20% Volatility) | Change |\n",
    "|----------|----------|-----------------------------|--------|\n",
    "| A        | 5.2%     | 4.4%                        | -15%   |\n",
    "| B        | 6.8%     | 5.9%                        | -13%   |\n",
    "| C        | 3.9%     | 3.2%                        | -18%   |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: Increasing volatility by 20% reduces risk-adjusted returns substantially. Scenario B, while strong under baseline, is sensitive to volatility shifts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Implications\n",
    "- Do not rely on a single scenario; validate across alternatives.  \n",
    "- Use MetricA as an early-warning KPI to monitor category divergence.  \n",
    "- Next step: set up automated monitoring and periodic scenario stress testing.  "
