# Mock Analysis & Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple workflow for mock data analysis, model training, and API deployment. It includes:

- Basic data analysis using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Linear regression model training (`sklearn`).
- Model serialization using `pickle`.
- Flask API for predictions and simple plotting.
- Optional support for Streamlit/Dash dashboards.

It serves as a template for data analysis and model deployment projects.
